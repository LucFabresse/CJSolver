CJSolver
========

CodeJam (http://code.google.com/codejam) is a programming contest.
It includes a lot of problems.
For each problems, 2 data sets are provided: a small one and a large one.
It is really interesting to learn programming.
You can try a solution on the small data set and also send it to the CodeJam web site to know if it is correct.
And then try on the larger data set.
 
*CJSover* is a framework written in [Pharo](http://www.pharo.org) to easily implement algorithms to solve a CodeJam problems. 
It simplifies file reading and writing.
It provides implementations of possible solutions to some problems.
And for those "solved" problems, I commit here the correct solution to then be able to run automated tests that re-run them.

HOW TO USE
